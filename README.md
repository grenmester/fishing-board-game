# Fishing Board Game

## Testing

Start the server first.

    cd server
    node server.js

If you would like the server to automatically restart on code changes to the
server, you can run it in watch mode.

    node --watch server.js

After the server is started, you can start the client.

    cd client
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
